TEST 1: Text-Only Observation Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Analyzing: "Reviewed EM data for March 2024. Found 
investigation EX-24-0312 completed 5 days late..."

✓ AI ANALYSIS COMPLETE

🎯 MATCHED REQUIREMENTS:
  • req_001 (95% confidence)
    Reasoning: Directly relates to EM investigation timeliness

🎯 COMPLIANCE STATUS: GAP
   Severity: MAJOR

🔍 KEY FINDINGS:
  • Investigation completed 5 days late
  • No CAPA initiated for the delay
  • Potential systemic issue

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Initiate CAPA to address investigation timeliness
  • Review SOP-EM-001 for clarity
  • Provide additional training to EM team

📚 ADDITIONAL CITATIONS:
  • 21 CFR 211.22
  • EU GMP Chapter 1

📎 EVIDENCE NEEDED:
  • Investigation report EX-24-0312
  • SOP-EM-001 (investigation procedure)
  • Training records for EM coordinator
```

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Auditor captures observation:
  ├─ "Found investigation EX-24-0312 completed 5 days late"
  ├─ 📸 Photo of EM dashboard
  └─ 🎤 "This is the second late investigation this month"
       ↓
Clicks "Analyze with AI"
       ↓
System sends to Claude Sonnet 4:
  ├─ Combined observation (text + image + audio)
  └─ All generated requirements as context
       ↓
Claude analyzes and returns:
  ├─ Matched requirement: req_001 (95% match)
  ├─ Status: GAP - MAJOR
  ├─ Key findings: Late investigation, no CAPA
  ├─ Recommendations: Initiate CAPA, review SOP
  └─ Evidence needed: Investigation report, SOP, training records
       ↓
UI displays AI suggestions:
  ├─ Auditor reviews
  ├─ Can accept all or modify
  └─ Saves observation with AI analysis attached
```

## 💻 Integration Steps

### **Option 1: Test API Only (Working Now!)**

```bash
# Already working - no integration needed
python test_ai_observation_analysis.py
```

### **Option 2: Full UI Integration**

1. **Replace observation form** in `audit_poc.html`
   - Find the `<div id="obsFormState">` section
   - Replace with content from `fieldwork_ai_enhanced_ui.html`

2. **Add JavaScript functions**
   - Copy functions from `fieldwork_ai_enhanced_ui.html`
   - Add to `<script>` section in `audit_poc.html`

3. **Test in browser**
   - Generate requirements first
   - Go to fieldwork tab
   - Create observation with AI analysis

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### **1. Multi-Modal Input**

```javascript
{
  observationText: "Written observation...",
  imageDescription: "Photo shows...",
  audioTranscription: "Voice note says...",
  requirements: [...]
}
```

All three modes analyzed together for comprehensive insight!

### **2. Smart Matching**

AI calculates semantic similarity between observation and all requirements:

```
req_001: 95% match ← SELECTED
req_002: 40% match
req_003: 15% match
```

### **3. Contextual Analysis**

AI considers:
- ✅ Regulatory domain (EM, Training, Documentation)
- ✅ Specific keywords and terminology
- ✅ Compliance implications
- ✅ Severity indicators
- ✅ Evidence availability

### **4. Actionable Output**

Every AI analysis includes:
- ✅ Matched requirement(s) with reasoning
- ✅ Compliance status with justification
- ✅ Specific findings extracted
- ✅ Practical recommendations
- ✅ Evidence checklist

---

## 📊 Test Scenarios Included

### **Test 1: EM Investigation (GAP)**
```
