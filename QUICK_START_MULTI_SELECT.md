## 💡 Best Practices

### **When to Link Multiple Requirements:**

✅ **Observation impacts multiple areas**
   - Example: Missing signature affects documentation (211.194) AND training (211.25)

✅ **Cross-functional issues**
   - Example: Equipment issue affects maintenance (211.63) AND validation (211.67)

✅ **Systemic problems**
   - Example: Process deviation relates to procedures (211.100) AND investigations (211.192)

✅ **Comprehensive findings**
   - Example: Batch record gaps touch multiple sections of 211.188, 211.194, and 211.180

## 🔍 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Documentation Gap**

**User Input:**
- Photos: 3 batch record pages
- Location: "QA Review Room"
- Interviewed: "J. Smith, QA Mgr"
- Text: "Missing signatures on batch record"

**AI Response:**
- **Matched:** 2 requirements
  - req_007: 21 CFR 211.194 (95%)
  - req_003: 21 CFR 211.22 (88%)
- **Generated Text:**
  ```
  During review of Batch Record BR-2024-1234 in the QA Review Room on 
  January 15, 2024, I observed missing verification signatures on critical 
  process steps (Image 1: sterile filtration, Image 2: filling). This was 
  confirmed through interview with J. Smith, QA Manager, who acknowledged 
  the gap. The batch record was signed for release despite the missing 
  verification signatures (Image 3).
  ```

**User Action:**
- Clicks "✓ Select All AI" (both requirements checked)
- Clicks "✓ Use This Text" (AI text replaces notes)
- Saves observation

### **Scenario 2: Equipment Issue**

**User Input:**
- Photos: 2 images of damaged HEPA filter
- Location: "Grade A Filling Line"
- Text: "Filter damage observed"

**AI Response:**
- **Matched:** 3 requirements
  - req_002: 21 CFR 211.42 (96%)
  - req_005: 21 CFR 211.63 (91%)
  - req_001: 21 CFR 211.113 (85%)
- **Generated Text:**
  ```
  During facility inspection of the Grade A Filling Line on January 15, 2024, 
  at 2:00 PM, I observed a visible tear approximately 2 inches long in HEPA 
  filter Filter-A-01 (Image 1). The filter label indicates it serves the aseptic 
  filling area. Image 2 shows the integrity test log with last test dated 
  December 15, 2023. This represents an immediate contamination risk requiring 
  shutdown per EU GMP Annex 1 § 4.18.
  ```

**User Action:**
- Unchecks req_001 (not directly relevant)
- Keeps req_002 and req_005 checked
- Clicks "✓ Use This Text"
- Saves observation with 2 requirements
