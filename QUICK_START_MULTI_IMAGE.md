## 💡 Best Practices

### **When to Use Multiple Images:**

✅ **Document different pages** (e.g., batch record pages 1, 2, 3)  
✅ **Show progression** (e.g., before → during → after)  
✅ **Capture different angles** (e.g., wide shot + close-up)  
✅ **Related evidence** (e.g., SOP + batch record + log)  
✅ **Multiple issues** (e.g., 3 pieces of equipment with problems)  

### **Tips:**
- Add photos in logical order (e.g., page 1 → 2 → 3)
- Use description field to add context for all photos
- AI will reference images as "Image 1", "Image 2", etc.

## 🔍 Example: Batch Record Issue

**Photos:**
1. Batch record page 1 (missing signature)
2. Batch record page 2 (overwritten time)
3. QA checklist (incomplete)

**AI Response:**
```
Visual Findings:
"Image 1 shows sterile filtration step completed but 
verification signature is missing. Image 2 reveals time 
entry overwritten without proper procedure. Image 3 shows 
QA checklist Section 4 not signed off."

Key Findings:
• Missing signature on critical step (Image 1)
• Data integrity concern (Image 2)
• Incomplete QA review (Image 3)
• Systemic documentation gap

Recommendations:
• Hold batch pending investigation
• Identify who performed verification
• Investigate data correction
• Complete QA review
```

Notice: AI connects findings **across all images** to identify systemic issues!

## 🎨 UI Elements

| Element | Location |
|---------|----------|
| **Add button** | Top of observation form |
| **Counter** | On button: "(3/5)" |
| **Gallery** | Below button (when photos added) |
| **Remove (×)** | Top-right of each photo (on hover) |
| **Photo labels** | Bottom of each thumbnail |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Button is grayed out**
→ You've reached 5 photos. Remove one to add more.

### **Can't remove a photo**
→ Make sure you're hovering over the photo to see × button.

### **Photos not analyzed**
→ Check backend console for errors. Ensure images are valid.

### **AI doesn't mention all images**
→ This is normal if some images are similar or don't show new issues.
